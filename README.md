# HeyBuddy
Deployable Link  [HeyBuddy](https://project2heybuddy.herokuapp.com/)

## Built with:
### HTML, Javascript, CSS, MongoDB, Heroku, Bootstrap, Passport, Express
______________________________________________________________
## Background: 
### For this project, I have decided to make a tracker. For friends' birthdays and for when you have last contacted them. I suffer from a poor memory and object permanence and I thought the idea for this tool would be very helpful. All the information is displayed on the main page, which means I don't have to scroll through different calendars or notes to find the relevant information. 
______________________________________________________________
## Getting Started:
### To use the app, you must start by making an account, and then logging in with that account
### When adding a friend, a name, birthday and last contacted are required fields (name and last contacted can be changed)
### You have the ability to add notes that pertain to every friend, and delete notes

### Below will be some screenshots showing the functionality:
